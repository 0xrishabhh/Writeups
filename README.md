# Writeups

Hi, I’m **0xR15Hi**. I’m a **Cybersecurity and DevSecOps enthusiast** with hands-on experience in SOC operations, vulnerability assessment, and cloud-native security. I enjoy breaking down complex security concepts through practical labs and real-world simulations.

This space is where I document my **TryHackMe writeups**, covering a wide range of labs including **web application security, cloud and container security, AI/LLM security, blue team analysis, privilege escalation, networking, and security fundamentals**. The goal is to reinforce learning, share knowledge, and track my growth across both **offensive and defensive security**.
